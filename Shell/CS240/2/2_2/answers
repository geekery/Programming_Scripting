1. use nG to position at n character in line..and then D for delete.

2. code for marking a line- "mx"...x is the mark on the line. ->
    : 't1,'t2 !awk'{print $5""$4""...""$1}'  for reevrting word numbers
5,4,3,2,1....t1,t2 are start line and end line for a block of text.

3. vague idea- open both files...and use:n to go to next file, then search
:\searchstring
:e# to go to previous file.

4. go to visual mode- v
   select a block of text (dont kno how to do it), maybe mark beginin and
end lines of block. then << for right shifting, >>for left shiftin of
block.
:set sw=4  for settin no. of characters to be moved.

5. to install vim-
 apt-set install vim vim-common vim-gnome vim-gui-common vim-runtime
